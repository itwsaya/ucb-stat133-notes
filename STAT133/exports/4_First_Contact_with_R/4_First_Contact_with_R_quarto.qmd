# 4.3 Exercises
**1)** Here’s the list of monthly expenses for a hypothetical undergraduate student
- cell phone $80
- transportation $20
- groceries $550
- gym $15
- rent $1700
- other $85
a. Using the `console` pane of RStudio, create objects (i.e. variables) for each of these expenses listed above, and then create an object `total` with the sum of the expenses.

```{r}
#| label: 4a44dc15
library(tidyverse)
# Monthly expenses as objects
cell_phone <- 80
transportation <- 20
groceries <- 550
gym <- 15
rent <- 1700
other <- 85

# Total assignment operator
monthly_total <- cell_phone + transportation + groceries + gym + rent + other
monthly_total
```

b. Assuming that the student has the same expenses every month, how much would she spend during a school “semester”? (assume the semester involves five months). Write code in R to find this value.

```{r}
semester <- 5 * monthly_total
```
