# 5.5 Exercises

**1)** Refer to the help documentation of `mean()` function, e.g.Â `help(mean)`. Scroll down to the **Examples** section:

```{r}
help(mean)
```

**2)** Find out how to look for information about math binary operators like `+` or `^` (without using `?Arithmetic`). _Tip_: quotes are your friend.

```{r}
help('+')
help('^')
```

**3)** Like in the previous exercise, use quotes or backticks to get the documentation of the **value matching** operator `%in%`.

```{r}
help('%in%')
```

**4)** Use the function `help.search()` to obtain a list of suggested functions about `"linear model"`

```{r}
help.search('linear model')
```
