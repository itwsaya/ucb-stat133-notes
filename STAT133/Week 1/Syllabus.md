STAT 133 involves itself with four focuses in regards to computational data analysis. These four focuses are:
- The understanding of [[data formats]] and [[data manipulation]] these formats (i.e. tidying & reshaping)
- The production of [[data visualisations]] and identifying their importance in data analysis projects
- The learning of principles for writing code as well as programming concepts in respect to data analysis
- The utilisation of computational tools in order to conduct data analysis, organise workflow, and become familiar with reporting tools (i.e. dynamic documents, web apps)

Given that STAT 133 is a core course for the Statistics major, the course aims to provide the foundations to compute with data in order for statistics majors as well as any other adjacent majors (i.e. Applied Mathematics, Cognitive Science, Economics, ~~Data Science~~, etc.) in order to take on upper-division courses involving the foundations of STAT 133.

The course aims to be able to enable students to:
- Construct and execute R programmes utilising elementary programming techniques involving tidyverse packages
- Visualise information and data utilising the appropriate graphing techniques
- Import data from files or the Internet
- Manipulate raw data into a tidy format
- Create visualsations utilising geospatial data
- Parse and analyse text documents
- Create reproducible docunents
- Construct interactive web applications

The course does not demand any prerequisites (but let's be ffr, it basically does). The curriculum is designed around no programming experience (but let's be ffr, if you have it you'll do well). Data analysis experience is also welcomed.

Advanced courses may be suggested unless required for a major or minor programme.

The course will primarily utilise R via RStudio and may utilise a command-line interface. A computer is needed to use R and complete assignments.

R knowledge is not expected, but knowledge from DATA 8 or previous Python coding experience can be transferred over. R has been developed by the statistics community explicitly for data analysis, while Python finds itself to be general-purpose with large data analysis capabilities.

Lectures are focused on the data analysis concepts, while application of them in R is the focus of labs and assignments.
